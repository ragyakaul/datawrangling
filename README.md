# datawrangling
I teach myself data analysis in Python to prepare myself for my very first data analysis internship.
My first approach was to follow the book 'Data Wrangling in Python' by Kazil and Jarmul but after Chapter 7 and grasping a lot of the fundamentals, 
I felt I needed to now start applying the knowledge I was learning and attempt to do something more hands-on. I decided to follow the tutorial 'Data Analysis in Python'
on FreeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) where I would learn some short commands and apply them instantly (through the given exercises/problems for each section), this course is around 
5-6 hours long in terms of video-content with corresponding exercises to solidify your knowledge. 


In summary, the files above are as follows:
-> Data Wrangling in Python text book: Chapter 2-7
-> Data Analysis in Python (FreeCodeCamp): Lesson2&3 onwards

[The db files are the databases used in the second course]

All code credit in the chapters & lessons goes to the official examples given in the respective book/course. My work is demonstrated in the files labelled 'Exercises'.
